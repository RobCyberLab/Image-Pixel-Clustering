## Overview📖
In this laboratory, we will test at least two of the following clustering techniques:
- **k-means**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **DBSCAN**

Using libraries that implement these techniques is allowed, with a **10% penalty**.

## Clustering Techniques🌀
The focus of this lab is to experiment with and understand the following clustering methods:
1. **k-means**: A partition-based clustering algorithm.
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: A method to build a hierarchy of clusters.
3. **DBSCAN**: A density-based clustering technique.

## Dataset Description📊
The dataset consists of images containing black pixels. Each point will have the following features:
- **x-coordinate**
- **y-coordinate**

---

## Distance Metric📏
The distance between two points will be calculated using the **Euclidean distance** formula. For performance reasons, extracting the square root can be omitted.

## Recommended Libraries📚
### For working with images:
- [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
- [Pillow](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/3.2.0)

### For clustering algorithms:
- [mlpy](http://mlpy.sourceforge.net/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

Feel free to explore the recommended libraries to implement these techniques effectively!
